# I3D-TensorFlow

An I3D model based on tensorflow.

## Introduction
This is an I3D model implemented on tensorflow(minor changes from yoosan/i3d-tensorflow), I also used the pre-trained weights of kinetics-i3d to initialize the I3D model, and altered some video preprocessing method and parameters. And my I3D model now has achieved the accuracy of **96.1%** using only the RGB mode.
